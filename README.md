# Data Science Course Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis for my data science course project. In this project, I explore a dataset, set hypotheses, probe them using statistical methods, perform data cleaning, wrangling, formatting, data exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and finally, train and test machine learning models.

## Project Overview
In this project, I aim to predict whether a client of the bank dataset will make a deposit or no. The main steps involved are:

- Setting hypotheses related to the data.
- Conducting statistical analyses to validate or refute the hypotheses.
- Performing data cleaning, wrangling, and formatting to prepare the data for analysis.
- Conducting exploratory data analysis to gain insights and identify patterns.
- Creating new features through feature engineering techniques.
- Training and testing various machine learning models to predict [target variable or outcome].

## Data
The dataset used in this project can be found at [Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez, and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 62:22-31, June 2014. The dataset contains the main attributes of a bank telemarketing campaign dataset.

## Hypothesis Setting
In this section, I formulate hypotheses related to the data. These hypotheses will be investigated and tested using statistical methods.

## Statistical Analysis
To evaluate the hypotheses, I employ various statistical methods such as t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, correlation analysis, etc. The findings will be discussed in [Results](#results).

## Data Cleaning and Wrangling
Before conducting any analysis, I preprocess the data by handling missing values, and outliers, and performing necessary data transformations.

## Data Exploratory Analysis
In this step, I conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This involves generating visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution and uncover patterns and relationships.

## Feature Engineering
I engineer new features based on domain knowledge and insights gained from exploratory analysis to improve the performance of the machine learning models.

## Model Training and Testing
I split the dataset into training and testing sets, and then proceed to train various machine-learning models. The models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, and their performance will be compared.

## Results
The results of the project will be summarized in this section. I will provide insights obtained from the statistical analysis and discuss the performance of the machine learning models.

## Usage
To run the code in this repository, clone the repository and execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to reproduce the analysis.
